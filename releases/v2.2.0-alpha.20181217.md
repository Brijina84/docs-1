~~~

### General changes

- The default disk size on Kubernetes has been changed from 1 GiB to 100 GiB. [#32428][#32428]
- A new cluster setting (`sql.defaults.conn_results_buffer_size`) can be used to control server-side buffering of results. [#32366][#32366]

### Enterprise edition changes

- Disable range merges on tables that are being restored or imported into. [#32538][#32538]
- Add timeseries metrics for debugging `CHANGEFEED` performance issues. [#32241][#32241]
- Add the option to supply Google Cloud Storage credentials on a per-statement basis with the query parameter `credentials`. [#32544][#32544]
- It is now possible to use AWS S3 temporary credentials for `BACKUP`/`RESTORE` and `IMPORT`/`EXPORT` using the `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` parameter in the URL. [#32455][#32455]

### SQL language changes

- Users can customize the auto-retry savepoint name used by the `SAVEPOINT` command by setting the `force_savepoint_restart` session variable.  For example: `SET force_savepoint_restart=true; BEGIN; SAVEPOINT foo` will now function as desired. This session variable may also be supplied as part of a connection string to support existing code that assumes that arbitrary savepoint names may be used. [#31971][#31971]
- The names supplied to a `SAVEPOINT` command are now properly treated as SQL identifiers.  For example, `SAVEPOINT foo` and `SAVEPOINT FOO` are now equivalent statements. [#31971][#31971]
- It is now an error to run `ALTER TABLE ... DROP STORED` on a column which is not actually a computed, stored column. Previously, this statement would be a successful no-op. [#32279][#32279]
- Many queries containing a correlated `EXISTS` subquery with a generator function can now be decorrelated and executed successfully. Previously, these queries caused a decorrelation error. [#31922][#31922]
- `IMPORT` uses larger integers sizes when converting unsigned MySQL integer columns to their signed cockroach counterparts. [#32481][#32481]
- An `ALTER TABLE` statement to add a foreign key constraint now automatically creates the necessary index if the referencing table is empty and the index does not already exist. [#32234][#32234]
- Queries involving `COLLATE` expressions are now supported by the cost-based optimizer. [#32500][#32500]
- Fix panic on `UPDATE RETURNING *` during a schema change. [#32188][#32188]
- Some categories of `SELECT` queries that return 0 or 1 rows (namely, queries by a PK, a unique index, or LIMIT 1 queries) are now guaranteed to not return retriable errors when running as implicit transactions (i.e., outside of a `BEGIN...COMMIT` block). [#32401][#32401]
- Added support for `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` with the `CREATE STATISTICS` statement. [#32643][#32643]
- Allow bpchar OIDs from client connections. [#32654][#32654]
- Fix panic when expression contains both a correlated and uncorrelated subquery. [#32443][#32443]
- Fix crash in `UPSERT` in the middle of a schema change adding a non-nullable column. [#32585][#32585]
- Fix error when configuring `NOT NULL` computed columns. [#32585][#32585]
- Fix deadlock when using `ALTER TABLE VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` in a transaction with a schema change. [#32772][#32772]
- CockroachDB now supports associating comments to SQL tables using PostgreSQL's `COMMENT ON TABLE` syntax. This also provides proper support for pg's `pg_catalog.pg_description` and built-in function `obj_description()`. [#32442][#32442]
- The `SHOW TABLES` statement now supports printing out table comments using the optional phrase `WITH COMMENT`, e.g `SHOW TABLES FROM mydb WITH COMMENT`. [#32442][#32442]
- The `INT` type is now treated as an alias for `INT8`. [#32831][#32831]
- Added `experimental_optimize_updates` flag, which uses the cost-based optimizer to plan `UPDATE` statements when set to true. [#32774][#32774]

### Command-line changes

- `cockroach sql` and other commands that print query results and query execution latency will now exclude the time required to prepare the display client-side from the latency measurement. [#32663][#32663]
- `cockroach workload` now includes the `kv` generator [#32719][#32719]
- `cockroach workload` now includes the `ycsb` generator [#32719][#32719]
- Adds debug merge-logs command to combine logs from multiple nodes. [#32790][#32790]

### Admin UI changes

- Minor copy render fix. [#32467][#32467]
- All existing uses of the Loading component now properly surface data errors. Previously, data errors weren't consistently surfaced. [#32464][#32464]
- The node map now uses an `equirectangular` projection. [#32617][#32617]

### Bug fixes

- Prevent non-superusers from seeing other user's sessions and queries via the `ListSessions` and `ListLocalSessions` status server API methods. [#32253][#32253]
- Avoid occasional unnecessary Raft snapshots after Range splits. [#31875][#31875]
- `CHANGEFEED`s emitting into Kafka more quickly notice new partitions. [#32297][#32297]
- Ensure that space in the temporary storage directory is reclaimed more promptly. [#32385][#32385]
- `experimental_avro CHANGEFEED`s now work with column `WIDTH`s and `PRECISION`s [#32474][#32474]
- Properly reject queries that use an invalid function in `UPDATE SET` (e.g., an aggregation). [#32505][#32505]
- Prevent `VALUES` clauses from returning incorrect results for certain special OID values. [#32494][#32494]
- CockroachDB previously silently and incorrectly accepted then ignored a `WHERE` clause after `INSERT ON CONFLICT`. This is now properly recognized and will produce an error reporting the feature is unimplemented. [#32556][#32556]
- Fixed an issue where calling `CREATE STATISTICS` on a large table could cause the server to crash due to running out of memory. [#32614][#32614]
- CockroachDB now properly handles foreign key cascading actions `SET DEFAULT` and `SET NULL` in `SHOW CREATE` and `cockroach dump`. [#32589][#32589]
- Fix a node data loss bug that occurs when a disk becomes temporarily full. [#32605][#32605]
- Fix a crash caused by `WITH ORDINALITY` in some cases. [#32596][#32596]
- Dates no longer have a time component in their text encoding over the wire. [#32144][#32144]
- Intervals now match Postgres in their text encoding over the wire. [#32144][#32144]
- Intervals no longer sometimes lose 1ns of precision. This only happened rarely due to floating point inaccuracy. [#32144][#32144]
- Correct `pgwire` encoding for arrays and tuples. [#32144][#32144]
- Correct binary decimal encoding for `NaN`. [#32144][#32144]
- Prevent crash when running certain subqueries that get planned in a distributed fashion. [#32652][#32652]
- Fixed a crash that could occur during or after a data import on Windows. [#32664][#32664]
- Lookup joins now properly preserve ordering for outer joins. Prior to this fix, `LEFT JOIN` queries under specific conditions could produce results which did not respect the `ORDER BY` clause. [#32317][#32317]
- CockroachDB now again enables admin users, including `root`, to list all user sessions besides their own. [#32629][#32629]
- Fix a panic involving json_agg and window functions. [#32716][#32716]
- CockroachDB no longer crashes when encountering an internal error related to invalid entries in the output of `SHOW SESSION`s. [#32713][#32713]
- Resolve a cluster degradation scenario that could occur during `IMPORT`/`RESTORE` operations, manifested through a high number of pending Raft snapshots. [#32594][#32594]
- Properly evaluate `CHECK` constraints after a row conflict in `INSERT ON CONFLICT`, when the `CHECK` constraint depends on a column not assigned by `DO UPDATE SET`. [#32779][#32779]
- CockroachDB now properly records statistics for sessions where the value of `application_name` is given by the client during initialization instead of `SET`. [#32754][#32754]
- `cockroach workload run` no longer includes data-only generators [#32720][#32720]
- Fix a bug where metadata about contended keys was inadvertently ignored, allowing for a failure in transaction cycle detection and transaction deadlocks in rare cases. [#32773][#32773]
- Fix bug where `SCRUB` would erroneously report that index keys were out of order. [#32908][#32908]

### Performance improvements

- Remove locking when reading physical time. [#32225][#32225]
- Use faster randomness source to generate transaction IDs. [#32238][#32238]
- More efficient execution for some queries with `GROUP BY` or `DISTINCT ON` and an `ORDER BY` clause where an index with a suitable ordering is not available. [#32307][#32307]
- Rewrite Raft entry cache to optimize for access patterns, reduce lock contention, and reduce memory footprint. [#32618][#32618]
- Re-enable usage of RocksDB FlushWAL which is a minor performance improvement for synchronous RocksDB write operations. [#32674][#32674]
- Replace Replica latching mechanism with new optimized data structure that improves throughput, especially under heavy contention. [#32865][#32865]

### Build changes

- `ncurses` is now linked statically so that the cockroach binary no longer requires a particular version of the `ncurses` shared library to be available on deployment machines. [#32959][#32959]
